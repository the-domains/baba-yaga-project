(Yeah, I have high standards.....:) </p><p>I have come up with something that might help make your life a little better and help you save money, and after all isn’t that a little life changing? </p><p>Here’s how I was able to save money and get out of debt. My husband goes over the big picture here. </p><p>But I thought I’d go over the “nitty-gritty”. The step-by-step, the things I did to become more self-reliant, build a food storage, and learn skills to help me stay out of debt. These things are not magical; they’re not even new, but they are real and they work! </p><p>Let me tell you the first thing I did to save money and prepare on the cheap. Even if you already do these things, maybe I can give you a few new ideas or even reminders. </p><p>I want this video series to be valuable to you and help you become more self reliant. I can’t think of a better way to start than to help you put/keep money in your pocket. </p><p>Here’s the first tip. </p><p>Stop using as many paper towels! </p><p>This is the easiest one! Am I suggesting that you never buy pa- per towels again? No! </p><p>There are a few jobs that I still do with paper towels (like clean up my dog’s accident on the carpet). But I don’t have them out on my counter for an easy grab. I went paper towel free for 2 months just to see what I could save, and I saved A LOT. </p><p>I saved well over $100. I have 3 boys and 2 dogs, plus a cat, so I have a lot to clean up, and I only have two extra loads of laundry per week. My “paper towel rags” as my youngest calls them are easy to fold and put away, so he can do that task without super- vision. </p><p>I designed a worksheet to help you keep track of what you save if you decide to give the Self Reliant School Paper Towel Challenge a try. (See the work- sheet on page 5) </p><p>Here’s a little secret: keep a small trash can, preferably one with a lid (a secure lid if you have a toddler), right by your washing machine filled with water, 1/4 cup borax and 1/2 cup of baking soda to soak the rags in. When you’re ready to wash the rags simply pour the entire bucket into your washing machine.</p><p><a href="http://selfreliantschool.com/why-getting-out-of-debit-should-be-your-number-one-prep-how-to-do-it-using-the-snowball-method/"></a></p><p>If You’re A Real Man You Won’t Avert Your Eyes! </p><p>So let’s take it a step further and suggest you cut back on all paper products, maybe even stop using them all together. That would include paper plates, paper cups, paper nap- kins, disposable diapers, feminine hygiene products, and if you’re brave, toilet paper. Before you scream ewwwww! let me give you a few things to think about and a few op- tions. </p><p>Paper Plates, Cups, and Napkins: I’m not sug- gesting you NEVER buy these products ever again. They actually can save you money, time and effort in a grid down situation. If you are relying on your water storage then using pa- per products makes perfect sense. After all you don’t want to waste drinking water to wash dish- es. So stockpiling these products is a good idea. </p><p>However, unlike food storage, paper products do not need to be rotated on a regular basis. Using regular plates, cups and cloth napkins can really help keep money in your pocket. Note: Cloth napkins are really expensive so consider using wash cloths as an alternative for everyday use. </p><p>Disposable Diapers: There is an age old debate about cloth versus disposable diapers. I’m not going to try to sway you either way. I just want to point out that disposable diapers are very expensive compared to cloth diapers and may not always be available. If you are at all preparedness minded it would be to your advantage to try using cloth diapers at least sometimes, not only to save money but also to be familiar with the pro- cess: how to fasten them, how to soak them, and how to wash them. Note: If you’re really squeamish about washing diapers you might start out using a diaper service; they are often less expensive than using disposable diapers. </p><p>Feminine Hygiene Products: Real men are still with me at this point, right? After all men have wives and daughters to look after. Yes, I am pro- posing you stop buying feminine hygiene prod- ucts. No, I’m not proposing you go back to the dark ages and use cloth. Turns out there is this really cool little device called a Feminine Protection Cup. My favorite is called the Diva Cup. You may find out that you like it far better than any other product ever made, including tampons and maxi pads. </p><p>Toilet Paper: This is where I will lose a few people for sure! Toilet paper is beyond a ne- cessity; some might argue it’s a basic human right. Again, I’m not going to try and con- vince you one way or the other. I just want to point out that toilet paper is expensive, and remind you that humans have survived without it through the ages. Some might even argue that you can achieve a higher level of hygiene using a bidet instead. </p><p>Of course you may not have the luxury of having a bidet in a grid down situation, which leaves you with a cloth option. These cloths are commonly called family cloths and are basically just cloth wipes that you use in place of toilet paper. </p><p>It’s really not that primitive. You simply have a stack of them in the bathroom along with a bucket of water and detergent to soak them until it’s time to wash them. Maybe family cloths are not something everyone can use on a daily basis but you might consider work- ing them into drills or perhaps letting young children use them; after all they have not yet been conditioned to believe toilet paper is a basic human right. (See Paper Products Chal- lenge worksheet on page 6) </p><p>What Kind Of Housekeeper Are You? </p><p>Now let’s talk about how I was able to save a lot more money, improve my health and be kind to the planet. No worries, I won’t tell you about a miracle supplement, there is no huge start-up cost to implement this information, and I’m betting it will work for you too. </p><p>The secret: I started making my own cleaners. </p><p>I will be the first to admit, I am not the best housekeeper on the planet, but, I do like a clean house, and it really bothers me when I do not have a clean house. The “bad house- keeper” part of me and the “I really need a clean house” part of me often have elaborate battles, which leave me exhausted and frustrat- ed. Once my three boys were old enough to do chores, I looked forward to the help. I didn’t care if the chores were done thoroughly; I knew my kids would learn in time and I saw the light of a shiny clean house at the end of the tun- nel, until I saw my youngest child with a bottle of bathroom cleaner in his hand. Thoughts of asthma, cancer, sterilization, and early death filled my head, and these thoughts were intensified by the fact that he always used twice as much of the product as necessary. I grabbed the bottle from him and told him he was no longer allowed to use cleaners, be- cause they are a cesspool of toxic chemicals. </p><p>Getting help with the chores did not work out the way I had planned; I would have to clean all the bathrooms myself. Then I realized I was using the same cleaner I had snatched from my child, and I was putting myself in the same jeopardy that I just rescued him from. Something had to change! </p><p>For a short time I entertained the idea of commercial “green cleaners,” but the price tag was outrageous. </p><p>With a bit of research, I found my solution. I could make my own cleaners! This was a win– win for everyone in my family. I got help with household cleaning, my kids were safe from toxic cleaners, and my oldest got to pretend he was a chemist as he tested new recipes. </p><p>And the pleasant side-note to this story: this change saved my family a ton of money! It turns out homemade cleaners are the cheapest and the best working cleaners around. Oh yeah, and we are helping to save the planet because the cesspool of toxic chemicals does not wind up in the sewer system, soak into the ground, or contribute to pollution caused by their production. (See Homemade Cleaners worksheet page 7) </p><p>Recipes You Can’t Live Without </p><p>You can save so much money by making your own cleaners; I hope you have started mak- ing at least some of your own scrubs and washes. I would like to give you recipes for four more “can’t live without” cleaners. </p><p>Vegetable Wash: If you cannot afford to buy organic produce (and even if you can) I high- ly recommend using a vegetable wash in addition to thoroughly rinsing your produce with water. Produce can have dirt, wax, pesticides and germs from other handlers. </p><p>Furniture Polish: Remember me telling you about that cesspool of toxic chemicals before? Well, furniture polish falls into that cesspool category. It is full of unpronounceable chem- icals that produce toxic fumes when sprayed. </p><p>Laundry Detergent: I think this is one of the biggest money savers of all time. Making your own laundry detergent is about 10 times cheaper than buying a commercial brand. It also helps those with sensitive skin, because you control the ingredients, including the perfumes that often cause skin irritation. </p><p>Laminate Floor Cleaner: I was afraid to try a homemade cleaner on my laminate floor for the longest time, but finally I recovered from the brain washing those cleaning companies did when they told me never to use anything besides their product on a laminate floor. Turns out homemade products do a better job. (See More Homemade Cleaners worksheet page 8) </p><p>Check Out Self Reliant School Membership!
