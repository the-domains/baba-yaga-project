![Exploring the possibilities of communal or collective social villages amid nature's splendor.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7570bd9ea06f20935d3f49a6c4cb8a33ae142047.jpg)

While not quite a separatist I value women and woman's space and have long dreamed of a community of like minded, feminist oriented women.

Michigan Women's Music Festival was an eye opening experience and having belonged to collectives over the years puts me in a position of seeing what is possible.

Currently leaning towards a collective arrangement where neighbors share things like a garden, but each owns their own piece of land. I would love to hear your thoughts on such a community and if you would be interested in such a community or in an all women retirement village.

Stay tuned for the adventure of creating a sustainable community with walipini, tower gardening, solar, and other back to the earth projects.
