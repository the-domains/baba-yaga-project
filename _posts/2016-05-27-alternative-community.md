Michigan was an eye opening experience and having belonged to collectives over the years puts me in a position of seeing what is possible. Stay tuned for the adventure of creating a sustainable community with walipini, tower gardening, solar, and other back to the earth projects.'

While not quite a separatist I value women and woman's space and have long dreamed of a community of like minded, feminist oriented women. Michigan was an eye opening experience and having belonged to collectives over the years puts me in a position of seeing what is possible. Stay tuned for the adventure of creating a sustainable community with walipini, tower gardening, solar, and other back to the earth projects.
