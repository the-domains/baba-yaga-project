  Location, location, location...... At this time I am looking at land online,
  mostly in western and upper state New York.  Oregon has had my eye more than
  once, but there are a number of factors that point eastward at this time. (one
  of which is quite personal.) Things to look for when purchasing land to create
  a community include many factors. Accessible water is high on the list,
  surface rights usually are a given, mineral rights, timber rights, and local
  building codes and ordinances as well as taxes and the tax structure can be
  important.  Will the local authority allow off grid? how big? Is there some
  water pollutant dumping into your lands water source before it gets to you? If
  it did what options will you have?  Will it support the trees and plants you
  need? Sadly today you also need to research where the farmers are that are
  doing GMO so you don't get your crops contaminated and then sued for patent
  infringement.. REALLY... Also would love to find some like minded partners so
  the acreage purchased can be greater. Thus the idea of a collective, where
  each owns a part of the whole... not to be entered into lightly, this is in
  the planning stages to create a safe women's space, safe haven for critters
  large and small, a return to a more sustainable for mother earth life in
  harmony with nature project. Got ideas? energy? money? desire not to do it all
  alone? we can talk.
