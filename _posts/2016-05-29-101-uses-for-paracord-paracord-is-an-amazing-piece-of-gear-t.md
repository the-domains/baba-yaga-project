101 Uses for Paracord Paracord is an amazing piece of gear that was developed during World War II. Initially designed to attach parachutes to harnesses, parachute cord, or paracord as it became known as, was later used for countless other things by GIs, and later transitioned into civilian usage. Sometimes referred to as 550 cord because it is rated for 550 pounds of pull, paracord is what's known as a "kernmantle rope". Kernmantle simply means that there are internal strands, known as the kern, protected by an external sheath, known as the mantle. We'll take at some potential uses of this amazing cordage below: 1\. Using a makeshift needle, use the interior kern strands as sewing line to 

mend clothing. 2\. Since a single strand of paracord is rated for 550 pounds of pull, loop it ten 

times into a coil and use it as a makeshift tow strap that will pull 5500 pounds -- enough to tow an SUV! 

3\. Use it to tie down items to the roof of a car and it will withstand the highest winds. 

4\. A length of paracord makes an instant clothesline to dry wet clothes. 5\. Use paracord to hang your food supply from a tree well away from your 

camp; this will keep the bears away. 6\. Replacing your shoelaces with paracord ensures you'll always have a few 

feet of it on hand when you need it most. 7\. Paracord makes a great improvised zipper pull to repair a broken zipper. 8\. Paracord's kern is fine enough to make great dental floss -- remember, 

you don't want dental problems in a survival situation. 9\. A single length of paracord strung between two trees and a poncho 

draped on top makes a great and dry shelter. 10\. Some paracord, a couple sticks, and a poncho makes a great hammock. 11\. The kern is excellent for making fine and nearly invisible snares that are 

also very strong. 12\. Use paracord to lash logs together and create a raft. 13\. Walking in deep snow is hard without snowshoes, but using paracord to 

lash a few evergreen boughs to your feet makes it far easier to walk. 14\. Use paracord to make a bow drill for starting fires, but make sure to 

practice at home first, before you actually need to make fire. 15\. Paracord makes a great sling to throw an improvised spear; the velocity is 

much faster than if you used your hand to throw it. 16\. A length of paracord and an old DVD or CD makes a great signaling 

device. 17\. A length of paracord with two small lashed to either end makes a great 

bolo to hunt with. 

18\. The kern can be used to make fishing line. Military spec paracord has seven internal strands, each made up of three smaller strands, so that's lots of line, and it's fairly fine as well meaning fish won't see it. 

19\. Use the left over mantle as a fish stringer to tie your caught fish through the gills. 

20\. Excess kern can even be used to make a fine but strong fishing net. 21\. Two sticks and a good length of paracord is an improvised splint. 22\. Finish off the splint by using a piece of paracord to act as a sling if need 

be. 23\. The kern is excellent to make improvised stitches from to sew up a wound. 24\. A paracord made into a loop and a stick threaded through it makes an 

improvised tourniquet -- turn the stick and the paracord will squeeze tight. 25\. Two long sticks and some paracord makes a great improvised stretcher, 

or if there is only one person pulling, it makes a handy papoose. 26\. String paracord around the perimeter of your camp, and attach a few bells 

or tin cans to this to make an early warning system. 27\. Paracord is easily rigged into a pulley for lifting all sorts of objects. 28\. Paracord is strong enough for rappelling, although it can chafe. For ease 

of handling and safety, use multiple strands. 29\. A Spanish windlass is easily made from a loop of paracord and a stick, 

and can exert tremendous squeeze pressure on most anything big or small. 

30\. Use a length of paracord to hang your compass around your neck. 31\. Paracord makes a great replacement drawstring for anything that needs 

one. 32\. Lash your fixed blade knife to a long pole with paracord and create an 

improvised and formidable spear. 33\. Wrap the handle of your Mag-Lite with paracord -- it will give it a great grip

improvised handcuffs. 40\. Use paracord as an improvised lanyard to keep your pistol on your body. 41\. Paracord makes a great tool for tying people together along the waist so 

you don't get lost on a trail. 42\. Paracord's sheath burns readily, so in a pinch you can use a bit of it as a

49\. Broke a pull string for a boat engine or chainsaw? Use paracord! 50\. Paracord makes an excellent replacement for guy lines on a tent, 

especially when strong winds are expected. 51\. Hunting kills need to be bled in order to taste right. Hang them from tree 

limbs using paracord. 52\. Use paracord as an improvised mooring line on a canoe or boat. 53\. Use a paracord lanyard on your canoe or kayak paddles to avoid them 

getting lost. 54\. Find a drip or damp spot on the side of a rock face? Put a piece of 

paracord line where the dampness is strongest, then place the end of that line inside a water bottle to collect the water.

silent sling system. 72\. Some paracord woven around a piece of leather or thin wood makes an 

improvised sandal or flip flop. 73\. Lash some paracord to radio antenna line and throw it up into a tree for

improvised carabiner. 95\. Lash your favorite six pack with a length of paracord then throw it in a
