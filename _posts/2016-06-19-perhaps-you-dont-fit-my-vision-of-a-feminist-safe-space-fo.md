  Perhaps you donâ€™t fit my vision of a feminist, safe space for women community
  but still see a need to change social interaction and cooperation. I have
  found a place online that could fit your bill. I have joined them as they seem
  to be a good place to seek out and find like minded individuals to go forward
  with the creation of my dream to have a self sustaining small community with
  field to table capabilities.

Perhaps you don't fit my vision of a feminist, safe space for women community but still see a need to change social interaction and cooperation. I have found a place online that could fit your bill. I have joined them as they seem to be a good place to seek out and find like minded individuals to go forward with the creation of my dream to have a self sustaining small community with field to table capabilities.

This group, https://newearthproject.org/looks like a good place to find like minded people who want to take responsibility for their own well being and create a better community for themselves and their loved ones.
