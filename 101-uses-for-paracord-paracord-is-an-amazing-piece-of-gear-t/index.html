Initially designed to attach parachutes to harnesses, parachute cord, or paracord as it became known as, was later used for countless other things by GIs, and later transitioned into civilian usage. Sometimes referred to as 550 cord because it is rated for 550 pounds of pull, paracord is what’s known as a “kernmantle rope”. Kernmantle simply means that there are internal strands, known as the kern, protected by an external sheath, known as the mantle. We’ll take at some potential uses of this amazing cordage below: 1. Using a makeshift needle, use the interior kern strands as sewing line to </p><p>mend clothing. 2. Since a single strand of paracord is rated for 550 pounds of pull, loop it ten </p><p>times into a coil and use it as a makeshift tow strap that will pull 5500 pounds – enough to tow an SUV! </p><p>3. Use it to tie down items to the roof of a car and it will withstand the highest winds. </p><p>4. A length of paracord makes an instant clothesline to dry wet clothes. 5. Use paracord to hang your food supply from a tree well away from your </p><p>camp; this will keep the bears away. 6. Replacing your shoelaces with paracord ensures you’ll always have a few </p><p>feet of it on hand when you need it most. 7. Paracord makes a great improvised zipper pull to repair a broken zipper. 8. Paracord’s kern is fine enough to make great dental floss – remember, </p><p>you don’t want dental problems in a survival situation. 9. A single length of paracord strung between two trees and a poncho </p><p>draped on top makes a great and dry shelter. 10. Some paracord, a couple sticks, and a poncho makes a great hammock. 11. The kern is excellent for making fine and nearly invisible snares that are </p><p>also very strong. 12. Use paracord to lash logs together and create a raft. 13. Walking in deep snow is hard without snowshoes, but using paracord to </p><p>lash a few evergreen boughs to your feet makes it far easier to walk. 14. Use paracord to make a bow drill for starting fires, but make sure to </p><p>practice at home first, before you actually need to make fire. 15. Paracord makes a great sling to throw an improvised spear; the velocity is </p><p>much faster than if you used your hand to throw it. 16. A length of paracord and an old DVD or CD makes a great signaling </p><p>device. 17. A length of paracord with two small lashed to either end makes a great </p><p>bolo to hunt with. </p><p>18. The kern can be used to make fishing line. Military spec paracord has seven internal strands, each made up of three smaller strands, so that’s lots of line, and it’s fairly fine as well meaning fish won’t see it. </p><p>19. Use the left over mantle as a fish stringer to tie your caught fish through the gills. </p><p>20. Excess kern can even be used to make a fine but strong fishing net. 21. Two sticks and a good length of paracord is an improvised splint. 22. Finish off the splint by using a piece of paracord to act as a sling if need </p><p>be. 23. The kern is excellent to make improvised stitches from to sew up a wound. 24. A paracord made into a loop and a stick threaded through it makes an </p><p>improvised tourniquet – turn the stick and the paracord will squeeze tight. 25. Two long sticks and some paracord makes a great improvised stretcher, </p><p>or if there is only one person pulling, it makes a handy papoose. 26. String paracord around the perimeter of your camp, and attach a few bells </p><p>or tin cans to this to make an early warning system. 27. Paracord is easily rigged into a pulley for lifting all sorts of objects. 28. Paracord is strong enough for rappelling, although it can chafe. For ease </p><p>of handling and safety, use multiple strands. 29. A Spanish windlass is easily made from a loop of paracord and a stick, </p><p>and can exert tremendous squeeze pressure on most anything big or small. </p><p>30. Use a length of paracord to hang your compass around your neck. 31. Paracord makes a great replacement drawstring for anything that needs </p><p>one. 32. Lash your fixed blade knife to a long pole with paracord and create an </p><p>improvised and formidable spear. 33. Wrap the handle of your Mag-Lite with paracord – it will give it a great grip </p><p>and you’ll have some emergency paracord available for use. 34. Use paracord in conjunction with a piece of tarp material to create an </p><p>improvised water catchment system. 35. Replace your watch strap with some woven paracord – both decorative </p><p>and strong. 36. Use paracord to bundle firewood together for easy transport. 37. Use a length of paracord to hang a lantern over your latrine pit for safety. 38. A couple lengths of paracord squirted down with some bore cleaner </p><p>makes a great improvised bore snake. 39. In a pinch, a piece of paracord can create an ultra strong pair of </p><p>improvised handcuffs. 40. Use paracord as an improvised lanyard to keep your pistol on your body. 41. Paracord makes a great tool for tying people together along the waist so </p><p>you don’t get lost on a trail. 42. Paracord’s sheath burns readily, so in a pinch you can use a bit of it as a </p><p>fire starter. 43. Use paracord to tie horses or dogs to a tree for the night so they don’t take </p><p>off. </p><p>44. Make an improvised tree stand by lashing a log between two trees about ten feet up, using paracord. </p><p>45. Paracord makes a great horse hobble for the night in a situation where there are no trees to lash the horse to. </p><p>46. A flexible piece of ash and a couple strands of the kern make an improvised hunting bow. </p><p>47. Paracord mantle can be used as an improvised strop to polish a razor or scalpel. </p><p>48. Paracord can be fun, too. A couple lengths of it suspended from a tree limb and an old plank makes a handy swing. </p><p>49. Broke a pull string for a boat engine or chainsaw? Use paracord! 50. Paracord makes an excellent replacement for guy lines on a tent, </p><p>especially when strong winds are expected. 51. Hunting kills need to be bled in order to taste right. Hang them from tree </p><p>limbs using paracord. 52. Use paracord as an improvised mooring line on a canoe or boat. 53. Use a paracord lanyard on your canoe or kayak paddles to avoid them </p><p>getting lost. 54. Find a drip or damp spot on the side of a rock face? Put a piece of </p><p>paracord line where the dampness is strongest, then place the end of that line inside a water bottle to collect the water. </p><p>55. Use a length of paracord as an improvised zip line to span a small canyon. Tie a rock to one end to send it across to someone on the other side, then secure it. </p><p>56. Paracord makes a great gillnet for fishing. 57. Using simple granny knots and some time, you can create an improvised </p><p>and super strong rope ladder entirely from paracord. 58.

Come back in a few hours to enjoy the water that accumulates inside due to condensation. </p><p>59. Wrap paracord around the handle of an axe or sledgehammer to cushion the shock of impact. </p><p>60. Paracord makes an effective improvised rifle or binocular sling. 61. Braid three pieces of paracord together wherever you need a thick piece </p><p>of rope to grip. 62. Tie off a couple lengths of braided paracord between two branches and </p><p>you have an effective improvised bar for doing pull ups. 63. Skinning and gutting a big animal by yourself is hard work. Use paracord </p><p>to spread the animal’s legs apart by lashing them to trees. 64. Use paracord to make a flag lanyard. 65. Toddlers are easily secured with a paracord lanyard, but you must not </p><p>leave them unattended. 66. A length of paracord with a rock lashed to the end makes an excellent </p><p>improvised impact weapon. 67. You can use paracord to make an improvised horse bridle or repair a </p><p>broken one. </p><p>68. Tie up the legs of a turkey when roasting. 69. Woven flat, paracord makes a variety of mats. 70.
