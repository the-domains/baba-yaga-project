            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>8 Survival Skills Your Great-Grandparents Knew (That Most Of Us Have Forgotten) - Bio Prepper</h1><p>Our modern society is highly dependent upon the "system." Not only do we rely upon utility services to bring us electricity, water and natural gas, but also on an incredibly complex supply chain which provides us with everything from food to computers.

Using Only PVC Pipe</h1><p>There's something that our ancestors all had on their property, which we don't often have today. No, I'm not referencing a barn, although that would be true. I'm referring to a well. City water is something relatively new, at least as we know it. Before that, people had to rely on well water for everything.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/887fe57cbf60d1b60d6d481b36061e393e727bb4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
